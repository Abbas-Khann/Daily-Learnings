April 15 Learnings(Day 43 JS Projects)
- Canvas is hard, Try it once and don't look back at it again
- All the inbuilt methods are different


General Learnings:

- In flexbox:
- If flex direction is row then align items will work vertically
- If flex direction is column then align items will work horizontally
- If flex direction is row then justify content will work horizontally
-If flex direction is column then justify content will work vertically
- Having a separate section for writing different sections of your css is a much better approach 
- Also figuring out your mark up first is extremely efficient rather than putting a tag and then writing stuff inside of it.
