Particular Project learnings (Day 38 of JS projects): 
- In order to get the 30 api users we don't need a slash in the end of the url
- But a slash is only needed if one is looking for a particular username so the apiURL would look something like this "https://api.github.com/users/"
- In order to fetch the repo urls we need to use "/repos?sort=created" after the Apiurl and the username
- Error status 404 is shown in the console if a profile is not found

General Learnings:
- Visibility property in CSS and Javascript
